# Haskell Security Response Team - 2025 January–March report

The Haskell Security Response Team (SRT) is a volunteer organization
within the Haskell Foundation that is building tools and processes
to aid the entire Haskell ecosystem in assessing and responding to
security risks.  In particular, we maintain a [database][repo] of
security advisories that can serve as a data source for security
tooling.

This report details the SRT activities for January–March 2025.

[repo]: https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories

The SRT is:

- Fraser Tweedale
- Gautier Di Folco
- Lei Zhu
- Mihai Maruseac
- Montez Fitzpatrick
- Tristan de Cacqueray


## How to contact the SRT

For assistance in coordinating a security response to newly
discovered, high impact vulnerabilities, contact
`security-advisories@haskell.org`.  Due to limited resources, we can
only coordinate embargoed disclosures for high impact
vulnerabilities affecting current versions of core Haskell tools and
libraries, or in other exceptional cases.

You can submit lower-impact or historical vulnerabilities to the
advisory database via a pull request to our [GitHub
repository][repo].

You can also contact the SRT about non-advisory/security-response
topics.  We prefer public communication where possible.  In most
cases, [GitHub issues][gh-new-issue] are an appropriate forum.  But
the mail address is there if no other appropriate channel exists.

## Haskell Security Response Team at ZuriHac + Ecosystem Workshop

Gautier will represent the SRT at [ZuriHac] and the [Haskell
Ecosystem Workshop][] (June 5–9).  This is a great opportunity to
collaborate on Haskell security tooling, either in person in Zürich
or virtually.

If you have a particular project or collaboration idea, please share
it in the [planning issue (#272)][ticket].

## Conference presentation: *Security response for open source ecosystems*

Fraser presented at [CrikeyCon], a cybersecurity conference in
Brisbane, Australia.  The talk *Security response for open source
ecosystems* explains why open source security matters and how to
start and run a security response team, based on his experiences
with the Haskell SRT.

The [slide deck] is available now.  Video of the presentation should
appear on the CrikeyCon [YouTube channel] at some point.

## Advisory database

3 contemporary advisories were published during the reporting period.

2 historical advisories were added during the reporting period.

2 HSEC IDs (HSEC-2024-0004 and HSEC-2024-0005) **remain** reserved
for embargoed vulnerabilities, which will be published later.

We ask community members to report any known security issues,
including historical issues, that are not yet included.


## Advisories for the GHC toolchain

Following preparatory work last year, 2025-Q1 saw the publication of
the first advisories for components of the GHC toolchain itself.  To
declare a GHC component as affected in an advisory, set the
`ghc-component` field (cf. `package` for the Hackage namespace):

```
[[affected]]
ghc-component = "ghc"
```

The valid `ghc-component` values are: `ghc`, `ghci`, `rts`,
`ghc-pkg`, `runghc`, `ghc-iserv`, `hp2ps`, `hpc`, `hsc2hs`, and
`haddock`.

We registered the `GHC` namespace in the OSV schema.  Advisories can
be browsed on OSV.dev: https://osv.dev/list?q=&ecosystem=GHC.


## Tooling updates

- Gautier updated our tooling to build with GHC 9.10 and 9.12
  support.  This involved switching our Atom feed generation from
  the unmaintained *feed* library to *atom-conduit*.
