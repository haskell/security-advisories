# Haskell Security Response Team - 2024 November–December report

The Haskell Security Response Team (SRT) is a volunteer organization
within the Haskell Foundation that is building tools and processes
to aid the entire Haskell ecosystem in assessing and responding to
security risks.  In particular, we maintain a [database][repo] of
security advisories that can serve as a data source for security
tooling.

This report details the SRT activities for November–December 2024 (a
two month period due to extension of the previous reporting period).

[repo]: https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories

The SRT is:

- Fraser Tweedale
- Gautier Di Folco
- Lei Zhu
- Mihai Maruseac
- Montez Fitzpatrick
- Tristan de Cacqueray


## How to contact the SRT

For assistance in coordinating a security response to newly
discovered, high impact vulnerabilities, contact
`security-advisories@haskell.org`.  Due to limited resources, we can
only coordinate embargoed disclosures for high impact
vulnerabilities affecting current versions of core Haskell tools and
libraries, or in other exceptional cases.

You can submit lower-impact or historical vulnerabilities to the
advisory database via a pull request to our [GitHub
repository][repo].

You can also contact the SRT about non-advisory/security-response
topics.  We prefer public communication where possible.  In most
cases, [GitHub issues][gh-new-issue] are an appropriate forum.  But
the mail address is there if no other appropriate channel exists.

## Advisory database

A quiet quarter…

0 contemporary advisories were published during the reporting period.

0 historical advisories were added during the reporting period.

2 HSEC IDs (HSEC-2024-0004 and HSEC-2024-0005) **remain** reserved
for embargoed vulnerabilities, which will be published later.

We ask community members to report any known security issues,
including historical issues, that are not yet included.


## Documenting SRT processes

Fraser spent some time documenting the SRT's internal processes, in
particular: running a call for volunteers, member on/off-boarding,
and the quarterly report.  The content is in the [`docs/`
subdirectory][docs-srt] of the security-advisories repo.

## Github Secure Open Source Fund

In November, GitHub [announced][gh-sosf] their *Secure Open Source
Fund*, which would initially offer USD 1.25M across 125 projects.
Gautier shared this via a Haskell [Discourse post] in December,
along with some project ideas.  Applications closed in early
January.  The SRT did not apply for the first round, and we are not
specifically aware of any other Haskell-flavoured applications.

The second round is scheduled for June and is accepting applications
now ([form]).  We encourage anyone who wants to apply to this
program to work on Haskell ecosystem security to reach out to the
SRT, so we can align and support the work.

[Discourse post]: https://discourse.haskell.org/t/rfc-github-open-source-secure-fund/11025
[form]: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDBalom0XhmJrvyI3kwD7dZ-dD4_uhmLNysVXtA8fH_WUKoA/viewform

The GitHub program raises the broader question of funding for
Haskell security work—a topic the SRT will explore further in the
coming months.


## Cabal version bumping via Renovate

The SRT acknowledges Janus Troelsen's work on Haskell support for
[Renovate], a dependency management tool that includes a bot for
bumping versions.  Basic support was [recently
merged](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/pull/33142), and
[work is
ongoing](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/31493).

Thank you Janus for tackling this critical gap in the Haskell
security tooling!

## Tooling updates

- Tristan added OSV schema validation to the CI checks
  ([#254](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/pull/254)).

- Gautier made big improvements to the appearance of the HTML export
  of the advisory data.  See the result at
  https://haskell.github.io/security-advisories/.

- CVSS 4.0 support: no further progress on this objective during the
  period.

- There is an outstanding ask from the OSV.dev project to define
  feedback channels for our advisories, so that consumers downstream
  of OSV.dev know where/how to provide corrective feedback on
  individual records
  ([#252](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/issues/252)).
