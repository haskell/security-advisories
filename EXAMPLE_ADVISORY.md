# Advisory Template - Title Goes Here

This is an example template for an advisory. Please copy this to packages/<package-name> and rename it to HSEC-0000-0000.md.

In this section of the advisory you can write an extended description of the vulnerability.

 * Markdown formatted
 * TOML "front matter". See README.md for schema.
 * Please include as much detail as you'd like.

A well structured advisory will include information like:

 > Acme Broken implements safe internal mutation using `unsafePerformIO`. However, in a multithreaded context, an attacker can cause a service to return the wrong answer by forcing an interleaving of writes that violates internal invariants. The flaw was corrected by replacing uses of `IORef` with `MVar` in commit abc123.
