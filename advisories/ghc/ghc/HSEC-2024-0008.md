# Sign extension error in the PPC64le FFI

Numeric arguments of FFI call on the PPC64le backend may result in
incorrect runtime values. For the most part, this bug only causes
availability and data integrity issues. However, in some circumstances,
it may result in other, more complicated security related flaws, such as
buffer overflow conditions.
