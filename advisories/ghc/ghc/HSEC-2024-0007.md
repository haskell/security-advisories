# Sign extension error in the AArch64 NCG

Arithmetic operations may result in incorrect runtime results on the
native aarch64 backend. For the most part, this bug only causes
availability and data integrity issues. However, in some circumstances,
it may result in other, more complicated security related flaws, such as
buffer overflow conditions.
