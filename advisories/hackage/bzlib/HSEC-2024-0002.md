# out-of-bounds write when there are many bzip2 selectors

A malicious bzip2 payload may produce a memory corruption resulting in a
denial of service and/or remote code execution. Network services or
command line utilities decompressing untrusted bzip2 payloads are
affected.

Note that the exploitation of this bug relies on an undefined behavior
that appears to be handled safely by current compilers.

The Haskell libraires are vulnerable when they are built using the
bundled C library source code, which is the default in most cases.
