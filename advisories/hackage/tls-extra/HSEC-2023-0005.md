# tls-extra: certificate validation does not check Basic Constraints

*tls-extra* does not check the Basic Constraints extension of a
certificate in certificate chain processing. Any certificate is treated
as a CA certificate. As a consequence, anyone who has a valid
certificate can use it to sign another one (with an arbitrary subject
DN/domain name embedded into it) and have it accepted by *tls*. This
allows MITM attacks on TLS connections.
