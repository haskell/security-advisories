# code injection in *xmonad-contrib*

The `XMonad.Hooks.DynamicLog` module in *xmonad-contrib* before
**0.11.2** allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a
web page title, which activates the commands when the user clicks on the
xmobar window title, as demonstrated using an action tag.
