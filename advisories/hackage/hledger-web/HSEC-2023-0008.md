# Stored XSS in *hledger-web*

An issue was discovered in *hledger-web* \< 1.23. A Stored Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in `toBloodhoundJson` that allows
an attacker to execute JavaScript by encoding user-controlled values in
a payload with base64 and parsing them with the `atob` function.

*hledger-web* forms sanitise obvious JavaScript, but not obfuscated
JavaScript (see [OWASP Filter Evasion Cheat
Sheet](https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet)).
This means *hledger-web* instances, especially anonymously-writable ones
like `demo.hledger.org`, could be loaded with malicious JavaScript to be
executed by subsequent visitors.

Reported by Gaspard Baye and Hamidullah Muslih. Fix by Arsen Arsenović.
