# x509-validation does not enforce pathLenConstraint

*x509-validation* prior to version 1.4.8 did not enforce the
pathLenConstraint value. Constrained CAs could accidentally (or
deliberately) issue CAs below the maximum depth and *x509-validation*
would accept certificates issued by the unauthorised intermediate CAs.
