# x509-validation does not enforce pathLenConstraint

*x509-validation* prior to version 1.4.8 did not enforce the
pathLenConstraint value.  Constrained CAs could accidentally (or
deliberately) issue CAs below the maximum depth and
*x509-validation* would accept certificates issued by the
unauthorised intermediate CAs.
