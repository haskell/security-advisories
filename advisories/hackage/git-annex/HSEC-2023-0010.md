# *git-annex* private data exfiltration to compromised remote

Some uses of git-annex were vulnerable to a private data exposure and
exfiltration attack. It could expose the content of files located
outside the *git-annex* repository, or content from a private web server
on localhost or the LAN. Joey Hess discovered this attack.

To perform this attack, the attacker needs to have control over one of
the remotes of the victim's *git-annex* repository. For example, they
may provide a public *git-annex* repository that the victim clones. Or,
equivalantly, the attacker could have read access to the victim's
*git-annex* repository or a repository it pushes to, and some channel to
get commits into it (e.g. pull requests).

These exploits are most likely to succeed when the victim is running the
`git-annex` assistant, or is periodically running
`git annex sync --content`.

To perform the attack the attacker runs
`git-annex addurl --relaxed file:///etc/passwd` and commits this to the
repository in some out of the way place. After the victim's git
repository receives that change, `git-annex` follows the
attacker-provided URL to the private data, which it stores in the
*git-annex* repository. From there it transfers the content to the
remote *git-annex* repository that the attacker has access to.

As well as `file:///` URLs, the attacker can use URLs to private web
servers. The URL can also be one that the attacker controls, that
redirects to a URL that is accessible to the victim system (and not
necessarily the compromised remote).

## Fix

The issue was fixed by making `git-annex` refuse to follow `file:///`
urls and URLs pointing to private/local IP addresses by default. Two new
configuration settings, `annex.security.allowed-url-schemes` and
`annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses`, can relax this security policy,
and are intended for cases where the *git-annex* repository is kept
private and so the attack does not apply.

## Impact on external special remotes

One variant of this issue can exploit a vulnerable external special
remote, and could not be prevented by `git-annex`. (`git-annex`'s own
built-in special remotes are not vulnerable to this attack.)

In this attack variant, the attacker guesses the hash of a file stored
on the victim's private web server, and adds it to the `git-annex`
repository. The attacker also has control of the server hosting an
encrypted special remote used by the victim's *git-annex* repository.
They cause that server to redirect to the victim's web server. This
allows the attacker to verify if the victim's web server contains a file
that the attacker already knows the content of, assuming they can guess
the URL to it.

Developers of external special remotes are encouraged to prevent this
attack by not following such HTTP redirects.
