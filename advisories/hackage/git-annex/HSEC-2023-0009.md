# *git-annex* command injection via malicious SSH hostname

*git-annex* was vulnerable to the same class of security hole as git's
**CVE-2017-1000117**. In several cases, `git-annex` parses a repository
URL, and uses it to generate a `ssh` command, with the hostname to ssh
to coming from the URL. If the hostname it parses is something like
`-eProxyCommand=evil`, this could result in arbitrary local code
execution.

Some details of URL parsing may prevent the exploit working in some
cases.

Exploiting this would involve the attacker tricking the victim into
adding a remote something like `ssh://-eProxyCommand=evil/blah`.

One possible avenue for an attacker that avoids exposing the URL to the
user is to use `initremote` with an SSH remote, so embedding the URL in
the *git-annex* branch. Then the victim would enable it with
`enableremote`.

This was fixed in version **6.20170818**. Now there's a `SshHost` type
that is not allowed to start with a dash, and every invocation of
`git-annex` uses a function that takes a `SshHost`.
