# *git-annex* command injection via malicious SSH hostname

*git-annex* was vulnerable to the same class of security hole as
git's **CVE-2017-1000117**. In several cases, `git-annex` parses a
repository URL, and uses it to generate a `ssh` command, with the
hostname to ssh to coming from the URL. If the hostname it parses is
something like `-eProxyCommand=evil`, this could result in arbitrary
local code execution.

Some details of URL parsing may prevent the exploit working in some
cases.

Exploiting this would involve the attacker tricking the victim into
adding a remote something like `ssh://-eProxyCommand=evil/blah`.

One possible avenue for an attacker that avoids exposing the URL to
the user is to use `initremote` with an SSH remote, so embedding the
URL in the *git-annex* branch. Then the victim would enable it with
`enableremote`.

This was fixed in version **6.20170818**. Now there's a `SshHost`
type that is not allowed to start with a dash, and every invocation
of `git-annex` uses a function that takes a `SshHost`.
