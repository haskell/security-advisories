# *git-annex* plaintext storage of embedded credentials on encrypted remotes

*git-annex* had a bug in the **S3** and **Glacier** remotes where if
`embedcreds=yes` was set, and the remote used `encryption=pubkey` or
`encryption=hybrid`, the embedded AWS credentials were stored in the Git
repository in (effectively) plaintext, not encrypted as they were
supposed to be.

That means that anyone who gets a copy of the Git repository can extract
the AWS credentials from it. Which would be bad.

A remote with this problem cannot be enabled using
`git annex enableremote`. Old versions of *git-annex* will fail with a
GPG error; the current version will fail with a pointer to this web
page.

## Remediation

If your repository has this problem, chose from one of these approaches
to deal with it:

1.  Change your AWS credentials, so the ones stored in the clear in git
    won't be used.

    After changing the credentials, make sure you have a fixed version
    of git-annex, and you can then re-embed the new creds into the
    repository, encrypted this time, by setting the
    `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment
    variables, and running
    `git annex enableremote $remotename embedcreds=yes`.

2.  Fix the problem and then remove the history of the *git-annex*
    branch of the repository.

    Make sure you have a fixed version of *git-annex*, and force
    *git-annex* to rewrite the embedded creds, with encryption this
    time, by setting by setting the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and
    `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variables, and running
    `git annex enableremote $remotename embedcreds=yes`.

    Then, to get rid of old versions of the *git-annex* branch that
    still contains the creds in cleartext, you can use
    `git annex forget`; note that it will remove other historical data
    too.

    Keep in mind that this will not necessarily delete data from clones
    you do not control.

3.  If you're sure that you're the only one who has access to the
    repository, you could decide to leave it as-is. It's no more
    insecure than if you had used `encryption=shared` in the first place
    when setting it up.
