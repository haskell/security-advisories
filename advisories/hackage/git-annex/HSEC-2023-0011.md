# *git-annex* GPG decryption attack via compromised remote

A malicious server for a special remote could trick `git-annex` into
decrypting a file that was encrypted to the user's GPG key. This attack
could be used to expose encrypted data that was never stored in
*git-annex*. Daniel Dent discovered this attack in collaboration with
Joey Hess.

To perform this attack the attacker needs control of a server hosting an
*encrypted* special remote used by the victim's *git-annex* repository.
The attacker uses `git annex addurl --relaxed` with an innocuous URL,
and waits for the user's `git-annex` to download it, and upload an
(encrypted) copy to the special remote they also control. At some later
point, when the user downloads the content from the special remote, the
attacker instead sends them the content of the GPG-encrypted file that
they wish to have decrypted in its place (which may have been
exfiltrated from the victim's system via the attack described in
**HSEC-2023-0010** / **CVE-2018-10857**, or acquired by other means).
Finally, the attacker drops their own copy of the original innocuous
URL, and waits for the victim `git-annex` to send them the accidentially
decrypted file.

The issue was fixed by making `git-annex` refuse to download encrypted
content from special remotes, unless it knows the hash of the expected
content. When the attacker provides some other GPG-encrypted content, it
will fail the hash check and be discarded.
