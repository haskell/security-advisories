# Hash flooding vulnerability in aeson

*aeson* was vulnerable to hash flooding (a.k.a. hash DoS).  The
issue is a consequence of the HashMap implementation from
*unordered-containers*.  It results in a denial of service through
CPU consumption.  This technique has been used in real-world attacks
against a variety of languages, libraries and frameworks over the
years.
