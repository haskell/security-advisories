# Hash flooding vulnerability in aeson

*aeson* was vulnerable to hash flooding (a.k.a. hash DoS). The issue is
a consequence of the HashMap implementation from *unordered-containers*.
It results in a denial of service through CPU consumption. This
technique has been used in real-world attacks against a variety of
languages, libraries and frameworks over the years.
