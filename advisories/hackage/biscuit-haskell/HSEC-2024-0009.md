# Public key confusion in third-party blocks

Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token
to the third-party authority. Instead, a `ThirdPartyBlock` request can
be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party
block and to sign it:

- the public key of the previous block (used in the signature);
- the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key
  interning in datalog expressions).

A third-party block request forged by a malicious user can trick the
third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong
keypair.
