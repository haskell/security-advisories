# Use after free in multithreaded lzma (.xz) decoder

In XZ Utils 5.3.3alpha to 5.8.0, the multithreaded .xz decoder in
liblzma has a bug where invalid input can at least result in a crash
(CVE-2025-31115). The effects include heap use after free and
writing to an address based on the null pointer plus an offset.
Applications and libraries that use the `lzma_stream_decoder_mt`
function are affected.

The Haskell *xz-clib* library vendors and builds the C
implementation.  The *xz* package does not use the multithreaded
decoder and is therefore unaffected.
