# Double Public Key Signing Function Oracle Attack on Ed25519

The standard specification of Ed25519 message signing involves providing
the algorithm with a message and private key.

The function will use the private key to compute the public key and sign
the message. Some libraries provide a variant of the message signing
function that also takes the pre-computed public key as an input
parameter.

Libraries that allow arbitrary public keys as inputs without checking if
the input public key corresponds to the input private key are vulnerable
to the following attack.

By using several public keys and messages, a malicious user with access
to the signing mechanism may build up insights into the private key
parameters resulting in access to the private key.

This shortcoming means that an attacker could use the signing function
as an Oracle, perform crypto-analysis and ultimately get at secrets. For
example, an attacker who can’t access the private key but can access the
signing mechanism through an API call could use several public keys and
messages to gradually build up insights into private key parameters.
