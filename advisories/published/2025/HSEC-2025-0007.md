# cmark-gfm: resource exhaustion due to quadratic complexity in parser

*cmark-gfm* is GitHub's fork of *cmark*, a CommonMark parsing and
rendering library and program in C. A polynomial time complexity issue
in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent
denial of service, due to quadratic complexity issues when parsing text
which leads with either large numbers of `>` or `-` characters.

The Haskell *cmark-gfm* package bundles the C sources and was affected
by this issue. This fix was released in the upstream C package at
version `0.29.0.gfm.10`. Version `0.2.6` of the Haskell package adopted
the fix (moving from `0.29.0.gfm.6` to `0.29.0.gfm.13`). Packages that
depend on *cmark-gfm* should update to `0.2.6` or later.

Users unable to update should avoid processing data from untrusted
sources or validate the input with other tools before using *cmark-gfm*
to parse it.

Pandoc `< 2.10.1` depended on *cmark-gfm* and could be affected by this
issue.
