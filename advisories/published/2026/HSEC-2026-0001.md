# Vulnerability in libsodium's validation of ed25519 elliptic curve points

A vulnerability exists in `libsodium` versions prior to 1.0.21 (specifically in `crypto_core_ed25519_is_valid_point`) due to missing validation of elliptic curve points (CVE-2025-69277).

The `libsodium-bindings` Haskell library is likely **not directly affected** as it does not expose this low-level function, and users of the high-level `CryptoSign` API are considered safe.

The recommended fix for advanced finite field arithmetic is to switch to Ristretto255, available since Libsodium 1.0.18.

Users who bind to `crypto_core_ed25519_is_valid_point` manually or via other means using a vulnerable `libsodium` system library should update `libsodium` to version 1.0.21 or later.
