# *git-annex* checksum exposure to encrypted special remotes

A bug exposed the checksum of annexed files to encrypted special
remotes, which are not supposed to have access to the checksum of
the un-encrypted file.  This only occurred when resuming uploads to
the encrypted special remote, so it is considered a low-severity
security hole.

For details, see commit `b890f3a53d936b5e40aa9acc5876cb98f18b9657`.

No CVE was assigned for this issue.

Fixed in *git-annex-6.20160419*.
