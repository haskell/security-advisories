remote</h1>
<p>Some uses of git-annex were vulnerable to a private data exposure and
exfiltration attack. It could expose the content of files located
outside the <em>git-annex</em> repository, or content from a private web
server on localhost or the LAN. Joey Hess discovered this attack.</p>
<p>To perform this attack, the attacker needs to have control over one
of the remotes of the victim's <em>git-annex</em> repository. For
example, they may provide a public <em>git-annex</em> repository that
the victim clones. Or, equivalantly, the attacker could have read access
to the victim's <em>git-annex</em> repository or a repository it pushes
to, and some channel to get commits into it (e.g. pull requests).</p>
<p>These exploits are most likely to succeed when the victim is running
the <code>git-annex</code> assistant, or is periodically running
<code>git annex sync --content</code>.</p>
<p>To perform the attack the attacker runs
<code>git-annex addurl --relaxed file:///etc/passwd</code> and commits
this to the repository in some out of the way place. After the victim's
git repository receives that change, <code>git-annex</code> follows the
attacker-provided URL to the private data, which it stores in the
<em>git-annex</em> repository. From there it transfers the content to
the remote <em>git-annex</em> repository that the attacker has access
to.</p>
<p>As well as <code>file:///</code> URLs, the attacker can use URLs to
private web servers. The URL can also be one that the attacker controls,
that redirects to a URL that is accessible to the victim system (and not
necessarily the compromised remote).</p>
<h2>Fix</h2>
<p>The issue was fixed by making <code>git-annex</code> refuse to follow
<code>file:///</code> urls and URLs pointing to private/local IP
addresses by default. Two new configuration settings,
<code>annex.security.allowed-url-schemes</code> and
<code>annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses</code>, can relax this
security policy, and are intended for cases where the <em>git-annex</em>
repository is kept private and so the attack does not apply.</p>
<h2>Impact on external special remotes</h2>
<p>One variant of this issue can exploit a vulnerable external special
remote, and could not be prevented by <code>git-annex</code>.
(<code>git-annex</code>'s own built-in special remotes are not
vulnerable to this attack.)</p>
<p>In this attack variant, the attacker guesses the hash of a file
stored on the victim's private web server, and adds it to the
<code>git-annex</code> repository. The attacker also has control of the
server hosting an encrypted special remote used by the victim's
<em>git-annex</em> repository. They cause that server to redirect to the
victim's web server. This allows the attacker to verify if the victim's
web server contains a file that the attacker already knows the content
of, assuming they can guess the URL to it.</p>
<p>Developers of external special remotes are encouraged to prevent this
attack by not following such HTTP redirects.</p><h3>Info</h3><dl><dt>Published</dt><dd>November 14, 2025</dd><dt>Modified</dt><dd>November 14, 2025</dd><dt>CAPECs</dt><dd><i>&lt; none &gt;</i></dd><dt>CWEs</dt><dd><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html">200</a></dd><dd><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/610.html">610</a></dd><dt>Keywords</dt><dd>exfiltration, historical</dd><dt>Aliases</dt><dd>CVE-2018-10857</dd><dt>Related</dt><dd><i>&lt; none &gt;</i></dd><dt>References</dt><dd><a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/security/CVE-2018-10857_and_CVE-2018-10859/">[ADVISORY] https://git-annex.branchable.com/security/CVE-2018-10857_and_CVE-2018-10859/</a></dd></dl><h4>Affected</h4><h5><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/git-annex"><code>@hackage/git-annex</code></a></h5><dl><dt>CVSS</dt><dd>CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N</dd><dt>Versions</dt><dd><code>&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; &lt;6.20180626</code></dd><dt>Declarations</dt><dd><i>&lt; none &gt;</i></dd></dl></div></div><footer><div class="HF">This site is a project of <a href="https://haskell.foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Haskell Foundation</a>.</div></footer></body></html></html>
