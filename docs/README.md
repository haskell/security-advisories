# Haskell Security Response Team documentation

The files in the directory document the functional and
administrative processes of the Haskell Security Response Team.

- [SRT membership processes](./membership.md)

Documentation for our tools, libraries and the advisory source
format live in the `code/` directory of the main repo.
