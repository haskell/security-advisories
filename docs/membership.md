## Member onboarding (and offboarding)

There are some necessary tasks when members join or leave the SRT.
These are:

- Update the member lists in this document.

- Add (or remove) the member from the
  `security-advisories[at]haskell.org` mailing list.  Contact the
  [Haskell Infrastructure Admins][haskell-infra] for assistance.

- Add (or remove) the member from the VINCE group, if they are
  participating in that capacity.

- Update the member list at https://www.haskell.org/security/.
  By pull request against
  [https://github.com/haskell-infra/www.haskell.org/](haskell-infra/www.haskell.org).

- Announce the membership change(s) on [Discourse].  Usually this
  could be included in the quarterly report.

## Running a Call for Volunteers

To fill vacancies or grow the SRT, run a *Call for Volunteers*.
The following is a rough guide on how we do that.

- For previous calls, we appointed an SRT member to receive the
  applications (to their personal email address).

- *After applications close*, they compile the applications and
  share with the rest of the SRT for review.  We start a voting
  thread on the mailing list, each member states their preferred
  applicant(s) with summary reasons, and we reach a consensus.  This
  process has worked well, so far.

- See [example content](call-for-volunteers-example.md).  There are
  some placeholders to be filled.  The content can be modified as
  needed.

- Publish the call on [Discourse] and promote it in the logical ways
  (e.g. Haskell Foundation social media, r/haskell, etc).

- The application period should be about 4 weeks.  Bump and do
  another burst of promotion at the halfway point.

- After the application deadline, the full SRT membership reviews
  the proposals and selects the new member(s).

- Notify the successful applicant(s) and seek their affirmation that
  they are prepared to join the SRT.

- Notify unsuccessful applicants before public announcement of the
  outcome.

- Commence onboarding and notify the community of the outcome.
