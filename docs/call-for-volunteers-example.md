**(PREAMBLE)**

The Security Response Team (SRT) is formally calling for
applications to join the SRT.  People from the Haskell community
with information security experience are encouraged to apply.  This
is an opportunity to have a large impact on the practice of Haskell
programming going forward.  If you have an interest in helping the
team continue its mission, please apply!

## Security Response Team responsibilities

The general responsibilities of the SRT are:

- Manage the Haskell Security Advisory Database, on behalf of the
  Haskell community and the Haskell Foundation.
- Triage and assess incoming security reports or proposed/candidate
  security advisories.
- Assist reporters to determine CVSS scores and CWE values for
  confirmed security issues.
- Communicate with package maintainers and the community to promote
  the timely resolution of reported security issues.
- Ensure the security advisory data are useful for downstream
  security tooling. (Development of downstream tooling is not an SRT
  responsibility, but engaging with the developers is)
- Report quarterly on the activities of the SRT and
  statistics/trends in new security issues.

## How can you help?
