# SRT reporting

The SRT is to report each quarter to update the community on the
activities and plans of the SRT.

## Who should write the report?

The SRT project lead prepares the report (though the task could be
delegated with sufficient notice).  It is a good idea to gather
items for the report through the reporting period, so you don't
forget anything significant.

## Publishing reports

The canonical version of each report is committed to this repo under
`/reports/`.

Each report should also be republished on [Discourse], and added to
the list of reports at https://www.haskell.org/security/ (file a
pull request against
[https://github.com/haskell-infra/www.haskell.org/](haskell-infra/www.haskell.org)).

Reports for the previous quarter should generally be published in
the first few weeks following that quarter.  In some cases we have
delayed a report to include significant new developments, e.g. the
result of a *Call for Volunteers*.

## Report content

Each report should contain:

- A preamble explaining what the SRT is and who are its members
  (just copy the preamble from the previous report).

- Statistics about the number of contemporary and historical
  advisories added to the advisory database during the reporting
  period.  Also mention any new or outstanding HSEC ID reservations
  (for embargoed issues), and any other significant updates to the
  **content** of the advisory DB.

- Discussion of any significant security incidents during the
  reporting period that impacted Haskell infrastructure, the
  toolchain, or the library ecosystem.

- Mention of notable updates to SRT-owned tools and libraries, and
  related developments in downstream tooling.

- Any other news related to Haskell ecosystem security.
