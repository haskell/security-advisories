## Maintainership policies

At all times, at least 2 SRT members should be in the maintainer
group for every SRT-owned package.

Trusted collaborators can be added as maintainers at the discretion
of the SRT.

Non-SRT maintainers (including former SRT members) must be regularly
reviewed.  We will revoke the maintainership of inactive or
unresponsive non-SRT maintainers, for safekeeping.
