This\nattack could be used to expose encrypted data that was never stored\nin *git-annex*.  Daniel Dent discovered this attack in collaboration\nwith Joey Hess.\n\nTo perform this attack the attacker needs control of a server\nhosting an *encrypted* special remote used by the victim's\n*git-annex* repository.  The attacker uses `git annex addurl\n--relaxed` with an innocuous URL, and waits for the user's\n`git-annex` to download it, and upload an (encrypted) copy to the\nspecial remote they also control.  At some later point, when the\nuser downloads the content from the special remote, the attacker\ninstead sends them the content of the GPG-encrypted file that they\nwish to have decrypted in its place (which may have been exfiltrated\nfrom the victim's system via the attack described in\n**HSEC-2023-0010** / **CVE-2018-10857**, or acquired by other\nmeans).  Finally, the attacker drops their own copy of the original\ninnocuous URL, and waits for the victim `git-annex` to send them the\naccidentially decrypted file.\n\nThe issue was fixed by making `git-annex` refuse to download\nencrypted content from special remotes, unless it knows the hash of\nthe expected content.  When the attacker provides some other\nGPG-encrypted content, it will fail the hash check and be discarded.\n","id":"HSEC-2023-0011","modified":"2025-11-14T14:45:34Z","published":"2025-11-14T14:45:34Z","references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://git-annex.branchable.com/security/CVE-2018-10857_and_CVE-2018-10859/"}],"related":["HSEC-2023-0010","CVE-2018-10857"],"schema_version":"1.5.0","summary":"git-annex GPG decryption attack via compromised remote"}
