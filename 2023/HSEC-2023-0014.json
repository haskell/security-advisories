This vulnerability allows an attacker to create or overwrite arbitrary files on the system (depending on the privileges of the process running pandoc).\n\nThis vulnerability only affects systems that (a) pass untrusted user input to pandoc and (b) allow pandoc to be used to produce a PDF or with the --extract-media option.\n\nThe vulnerability is patched in pandoc 3.1.4.\n","id":"HSEC-2023-0014","modified":"2023-08-22T23:08:06Z","published":"2023-08-22T23:08:06Z","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/security/advisories/GHSA-xj5q-fv23-575g"}],"schema_version":"1.5.0","summary":"Arbitrary file write is possible when using PDF output or --extract-media with untrusted input"}
