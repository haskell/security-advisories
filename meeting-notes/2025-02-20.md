# SRT meeting 2025-02-20

Previously:
https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/blob/main/meeting-notes/2025-02-05.md

Attended: Gautier, Lei, Tristan, Fraser

## Tooling - GHC 9.10 and GHC 9.12 support

- 9.10 support still depends on update to the
  [`feed`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/feed) package.
  Probably just a *base* bounds nudge is needed, e.g. via metadata
  revision.
- 9.12 needs CI updates.  And also `feed`.  And what else?  We don't
  know yet :)
    - haskell-ci refresh probably needed
- Gautier will take a look at it.

## ZuriHac / Ecosystem Workshop

- Ecosystem Workshop Friday 6 June
  - https://haskell.foundation/events/2025-haskell-implementors-workshop.html
- ZuriHac Saturday 7 .. Monday 9 June
  - https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2025/
- Gautier will attend ZuriHac, not the workshop
- Tristan is not able to commit
- Fraser is not sure yet (it's 50/50).

## List spam

- It's a shame...
- Can we allow-list the SRT members and other stakeholders?

## Meeting calendar

- FT will check with Jose if he can update the events.
- Otherwise, artisanal hand-crafted iCalendar events :)
