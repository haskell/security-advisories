Present: Fraser, Gautier, Montez, Tristan

## Onboarding

The new team members have been introduced to the on-going work.

## GitHub Open Source Secure Fund

GitHub opened a program to [fund securisaton of FOSS projects](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/announcing-github-secure-open-source-fund/)
until January 7th.

- Project ideas:
  - GitHub integration
    - Correct file/line
    - Snippet proposition/PR opening
  - Hackage
    - show known vulnerability info
  - vulnerabilities endpoints (publish vulnerability info)
    - e.g. `advisories.haskell.org/...`
    - [API server (#166)](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/issues/166)
  - improve the HTML presentation of the advisories
    - https://haskell.github.io/security-advisories/advisory/...

- OSV ask: `human_link` source definition
    - https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/issues/252
    - We can already address this - link to e.g.
      `https://haskell.github.io/security-advisories/HSEC-xxxx`
      - Montez will take this side.
    - But we should also improve the HTML presentation in those pages.
      - Gautier will take this side.

- OSV ask: JSON Schema validation
  - https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/issues/251
  - JSON schema:
    https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/blob/main/validation/schema.json
  - Tristan will take the first look

- Onboarding
    - Follow-up on mailing list membership for Lei and Montez
    - Github org membership, sorted now, but Fraser to add this step
      to the onboarding docs.
