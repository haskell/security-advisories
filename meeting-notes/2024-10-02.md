# SRT meeting 2024-10-02

Previously: https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/blob/main/meeting-notes/2024-09-04.md

## Quarterly report

Fraser will draft this weekend, and send to list for review.

## New SRT members

Application period closed.  There were 4 applications.
Fraser will compile them and share in the coming days.

## Hacktoberfest (GitHub)

- Hécate asks us to put forward some issues.
- `good-first-issue` (or similar) label?
- Let's review the open issues and discuss on-list, then share with Hécate.

## Hackage packages release

- Downstream (`cabal-audit`, `flora`) ask for it (the new `hsec-sync` does not rely on `git`)
- Too much work left to be done on `CVSS 4.0`, it'll be shipped in the next release

## Trusted publishing and fuzzing

- Mihai still to do this prep/proposal.

## Prospectus

- Prospectus of ideas for SRT (or other people working on Haskell security)
  will be valuable for HF in asking for funding.
- So, we need to put it together :)

## GHC 9.10 support in tools/libs

- Still waiting on `feed` which does not support base-4.20.
- Probably need to nudge Hackage trustees for a metadata revision.

## Outstanding PR review

- We went through the outstanding PRs in our repo; discussed
  what to do with them.
