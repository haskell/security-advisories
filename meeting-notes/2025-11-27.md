# SRT meeting 2025-11-27

Previously: https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/blob/main/meeting-notes/2025-10-30.md

## Status on embargoed advisory
(redacted)

## Repo re-org

- It was merged, some stuff broke (including cabal-audit)

- Fraser fixed OSV publishing.

Downstream breakage:

- Report:
  https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/issues/304
  (Gautier will brain-dump into that discussion)
- cabal-audit report:
  https://github.com/MangoIV/cabal-audit/issues/64

- Lesson: we need integration tests
- **Idea: should we write an integration guide?**
