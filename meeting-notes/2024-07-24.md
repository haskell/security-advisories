## Call for Volunteers

- We should draft and publish one soon.
- Q: call for a specific number, or wait and see?
    - Be general and commit later.
- We can mention particular projects / initiatives and applicants
  can (optionally) identify the particular area(s) they'd like to
  tackle.
  - This includes development efforts, and "latent capacity" for
    dealing with advisory or security incidents.
- José will draft an announcement, and we will review on the mailing
  list.


## Mailing list

- FT will make sure José is on it!


## Bay Area Haskell meetup 

- Mihai will present about SRT at a future session
