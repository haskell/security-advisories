## Thank-yous

- Thanks Tristan for handling HSEC-2025-0001.
- Thanks Gautier for completing support for GHC 9.10,
  by switching from *feed* to *atom-conduit*.
  - 9.12 PR is ready for review.

## ZuriHac + Ecosystem Workshop

- Gautier confirmed his attendence for the full event.
- FT still a maybe.

## HSEC-2024-000{6,7,8}

- 2025-0001 reminded me of the outstanding PR for the GHC numeric bugs:
  [#214](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/pull/214).
- IIRC, the delay was to get the tool support for GHC
  (cf Hackage) ecosystem in place.  This is all sorted now;
  e.g. see https://osv.dev/vulnerability/HSEC-2025-0001.
- Let's merge it?

## Conf presentation - Security response for open source ecosystems

- FT will present at CrikeyCon this weekend.
- https://crikeycon.com/schedule/
- I will circulate the slide deck for review tomorrow - feedback welcome.

## Mailing list delivery issues?

- FT: Did anyone else get a big burst of delayed mail yesterday/this
  morning?
- Confirmed - but I guess it's fixed now :)
