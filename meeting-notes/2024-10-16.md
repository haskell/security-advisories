# SRT meeting 2024-10-16

## Call for Volunteers

- FT sent each of the 4 application to the list
- Upon discussion, we will accept 2
- SRT members, please review and respond on the ML (the initial thread)

## Stack traces proposal

- CLC proposal:
  https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/285#issuecomment-2414727239
- Discussion:
    - For 2 decades people wanted stack traces, now we have them
      there are doubts :D
    - Most other languages are showing the stack trace
    - Sensitive information in error messages is an application
      developer's fault
    - It's not unreasonable to want a way to disable the default
      behaviour, or catch and suppress, if the actual program
      structure (e.g. function names) is sensitive for some reason.
    - The proposal Part 2 seems to suggest the stacktrace would be
      leaked with `displayException` too, which might be used for
      end-user facing message, perhaps it would be safer to only
      print them through the main exception handler. That's how
      python does it, printing an exception just show the error, the
      stacktrace is only displayed by default from uncaught
      exception. 

## Draft quarterly report

- call for volunteers update
- advisory DB changes (1 new vuln, 0 historical, 2 reserved)
- HSEC-2024-0003 update
- haskell.org Apache httpd update
- hackage-server "Reporting Vulnerabilities" link
- tooling update
    - CVSS 4.0 work (ongoing)
    - GHA / Renovate progress

## GHC hash collision

- Simon PJ and FT think it is not a huge deal
- But we should fix it.
- Changing the Hash function is simple and buys us another 10-20
  years (hopefully)

### Documenting known weaknesses

This is a good opportunity to take a look at the ways
that the compiler/toolchain can be compromised by malicious
source code, and document them.  Guide / blog post / GHC docs.

Many of these would not warrant an HSEC-ID (especially structural
issues that are impossible / very hard to fix), but we can still
collect them and let the community know in a more formal way.

## GHC numeric bug

- Tristan will rebase the advisory draft #214

## Updated major dependencies for hsec-tools

#239 and #241
