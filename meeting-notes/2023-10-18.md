[Previous meeting notes](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/blob/main/meeting-notes/2023-10-04.md)

## Present

- Tristan, Gautier and Fraser

## Previous AIs

- PR have been merged

## Remaining work to be merged

- CWE and CVSS validation and data type
- Work on GitHub workflow automation enhancement can proceed when this has been merged.
    - FT: As far as I know, we have to pursue a webhook or "bot" approach
      rather than exeucting behaviour within webhooks, because PRs from
      forks do not have privileged tokens.
    - Tristan: what about issues?  Do actions triggered by issues have the needed permissions?
    - OpenStack CI has a concept of config job which can run with privileged on untrusted project.

## Downstream tooling

- David's post calling for action:
  https://discourse.haskell.org/t/would-you-like-to-write-a-security-advisory-analyzer/7638
- Gautier: community contribution that was merged as part of the `check` command: https://github.com/blackheaven/security-advisories/pull/2

## Outstanding embargoed issue

- Follow up with Mihai if he knows the status.  We might
  set a date for disclosure and advise downstream and upstream
