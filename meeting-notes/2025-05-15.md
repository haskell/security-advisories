## proposal: c-lib best practices guide

- Two recommended approaches:
  - Use system clibs
  - Bundle the clib in a standalone cabal package, then depend on
    that.  e.g.:
    - https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lzma-clib
    - https://hackage.haskell.org/package/libyaml-clib
- Write up the recommended approaches and discourage other kinds of
  vendoring.
- FT will propose to mailing list and see if someone will take it
  on.


## ZuriHac ideas

- Gautier and Fraser populated the idea list:
  https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/issues/272
- Ecosystem library review, i.e. for security-related use cases,
  what libs are there. Can we do a list with commentary?
