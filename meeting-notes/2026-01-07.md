# SRT meeting 2026-01-07

## `libsodium-bindings`

Following [Haskell Cryptographic Group's `libsodium-bindings` announcement](https://haskell-cryptography.org/blog/libsodium-vulnerability-ed25519-valid-points/),
Gautier has [created an advisory](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/pull/308).

It occurs that the library was not exposing the vulnerability, which is only present in the cbits.

Fraser pushed to avoid creating advisories when only cbits are involved.

## Status on embargoed advisory
(redacted)

## Other works

* Fraser's Haskell Interlude Podcast is scheduled for next week
* Montez plans to work on the refunding prospectus draft
