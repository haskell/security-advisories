A polynomial time complexity\nissue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and\nsubsequent denial of service, due to quadratic complexity issues\nwhen parsing text which leads with either large numbers of `>` or\n`-` characters.\n\nThe Haskell *cmark-gfm* package bundles the C sources and was\naffected by this issue.  This fix was released in the upstream C\npackage at version `0.29.0.gfm.10`.  Version `0.2.6` of the Haskell\npackage adopted the fix (moving from `0.29.0.gfm.6` to\n`0.29.0.gfm.13`).  Packages that depend on *cmark-gfm* should update\nto `0.2.6` or later.\n\nUsers unable to update should avoid processing data from untrusted\nsources or validate the input with other tools before using\n*cmark-gfm* to parse it.\n\nPandoc `< 2.10.1` depended on *cmark-gfm* and could be affected by\nthis issue.\n","id":"HSEC-2025-0007","modified":"2025-12-27T08:58:56Z","published":"2025-12-27T08:58:56Z","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kivikakk/cmark-gfm-hs/commit/1359b8740c6b29dde0ad8f816531112b32eb8cbe"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/commit/2300c1bd2c8226108885bf019655c4159cf26b59"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-66g8-4hjf-77xh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24824"}],"schema_version":"1.5.0","summary":"cmark-gfm: resource exhaustion due to quadratic complexity in parser"}
