Where a package is only defined in a private\nrepository, this behaviour leads to a [*dependency confusion*][blog]\nsupply chain vulnerability.  If the private package name becomes\nknown, a malicious actor can claim the name in the public repository\nand publish a malicious version at a higher version number.\n\nDefault `cabal-install` configurations that only use the\n`hackage.haskell.org` repository are not affected.  Configurations\nthat use curated private repositories **exclusively** are also not\naffected.\n\n[blog]: https://frasertweedale.github.io/blog-fp/posts/2021-02-12-haskell-dependency-confusion.html\n\n\n## Mitigations\n\n*cabal-install* version **3.4.0.0** and higher provide an `override`\noption in the repository configuration.  It marks the associated\nrepository as canonical for all packages defined in that repository.\nNo other repositories will be considered.  For example:\n\n```\n-- For packages in repo.example.com,\n-- only versions in repo.example.com are considered\nactive-repositories:\n  , hackage.haskell.org\n  , repo.example.com:override\n```\n\nUsers and organisations using private repositories that contain\nprivate packages in addition to public repositories **MUST** use the\n`override` option to prevent dependency confusion attacks.\n\nAlternatively, projects and organisations can run a private instance\nof *hackage-server* and carefully curate and review its contents.\nUsing that instance exclusively defeats supply chain attacks\nincluding *dependency confusion*.  For *cabal-install < 3.4* and\nwhere using multiple repositories, this is the only effective\nmitigation against dependency confusion attacks.\n","id":"HSEC-2025-0005","modified":"2025-07-13T13:03:59Z","published":"2025-07-13T13:03:59Z","references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://frasertweedale.github.io/blog-fp/posts/2021-02-12-haskell-dependency-confusion.html"}],"schema_version":"1.5.0","summary":"cabal-install dependency confusion"}
