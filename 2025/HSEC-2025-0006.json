If a child process is `exec`ed at the same time, it would\ninherit that file descriptor and could read the private key\nmaterial.\n\nImpact is limited to child processes that run untrusted code, but\nthat do not close inherited file descriptors. (For example, the\n`su(1)` command.)\n\nThis leak was fixed by setting the *close-on-exec* flag on\nunix-based systems.\n","id":"HSEC-2025-0006","modified":"2025-11-17T02:22:38Z","published":"2025-11-17T02:22:38Z","references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/crypton-certificate/commit/e353d450c381c9d6b903c4257927e0c89c97acb1"}],"schema_version":"1.5.0","summary":"Private key leak via inherited file descriptor"}
